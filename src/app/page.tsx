          The HAHZ LOVE Manifestation Game is a positivity-driven social game where
          players have one job: to keep other holders' vibes high by sharing positive
          energy in their comments, DMs, or in real lifeâ€”even by helping them manifest.
          In return, the person receiving the positive vibes tips the player who raised
          their vibe with HAHZ LOVE, sent to their Solana Phantom wallet (@username).
